# Moral Life Audit

Diagnose whether a person, organization, or practice is living/operating authentically or artificially, using Leo Tolstoy's framework from *The Death of Ivan Ilyich*.

**Token Budget:** ~850 tokens. Reserve tokens for diagnosis output.

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Use this framework to shame or condemn individuals
- Diagnose mental health conditions (this is philosophical, not clinical)
- Generate content that promotes harmful self-judgment

**If asked to weaponize this for judgment:** Refuse; explain the audit is for self-examination and organizational reflection, not condemnation.

---

## When to Use

- When questioning whether a career path is meaningful
- When evaluating organizational culture for authenticity
- When a decision feels "successful" but hollow
- When examining whether practices serve genuine purposes or mere convention
- When someone experiences Ivan Ilyich's realization: "maybe I did not live as I ought to have done"

**Trigger phrases:**
- "Am I living authentically?"
- "Is this organization authentic or performing?"
- "Ivan Ilyich test"
- "Is this artificial or authentic?"
- "Run a moral life audit"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `subject` | Yes | The life, career, organization, or practice to audit |
| `context` | No | Relevant background (time in role, recent events, concerns) |
| `focus_area` | No | Specific dimension to emphasize (relationships, work, values) |

## Background: The Tolstoyan Framework

In *The Death of Ivan Ilyich* (1886), Tolstoy presents two types of life:

### The Artificial Life
Ivan Ilyich represents the artificial life - the successful judge who did everything society expected, achieved everything society rewarded, and discovered at death that it was all meaningless.

**Markers of artificial life:**
- Shallow relationships based on utility
- Self-interest as primary motivation
- Materialism and status accumulation
- Insular existence focused on personal gain
- Following convention rather than asking what is truly good
- Incapable of answering life's important questions

### The Authentic Life
Gerasim, the peasant servant, represents authentic life - simple, compassionate, present.

**Markers of authentic life:**
- Pity and compassion as natural responses
- Seeing others as individuals with unique thoughts and feelings
- Mutually affirming relationships that break down isolation
- Genuine human connection
- Living by truth rather than convention

**Ivan's Key Insight:**
Vladimir Nabokov summarized the Tolstoyan formula: "Ivan lived a bad life and since the bad life is nothing but the death of the soul, then Ivan lived a living death; and since beyond death is God's living light, then Ivan died into a new life."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Life Data

Document the observable elements of the subject:
- What does success look like here?
- What relationships exist and on what basis?
- What provides meaning or satisfaction?
- What is being pursued and why?
- How are others treated and regarded?

### Step 2: Apply Authenticity Indicators

Evaluate against the authentic life criteria:

| Indicator | Authentic | Artificial |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Relationships** | Based on genuine care for persons | Based on utility and status |
| **Motivation** | Intrinsic meaning, contribution | External validation, acquisition |
| **View of Others** | Unique individuals with inherent worth | Means to ends, obstacles, audiences |
| **Response to Suffering** | Compassion, presence, solidarity | Avoidance, discomfort, distancing |
| **Purpose** | Examined, chosen, aligned with values | Inherited, conventional, unexamined |
| **Time Orientation** | Present, alive to the moment | Future projection, constant striving |

### Step 3: Identify the Ivan Ilyich Symptoms

Look for the warning signs that Ivan experienced:
- Doing what everyone in one's position does
- Purchasing things because successful people purchase such things
- Feeling satisfied because one is supposed to feel satisfied
- Avoiding questions about genuine meaning
- Keeping busy to prevent deeper reflection

### Step 4: Locate Sources of Authenticity

Even in artificial lives, look for genuine elements:
- Moments of true connection
- Activities done for their own sake
- Relationships not based on utility
- Times when convention was questioned

### Step 5: Generate the Diagnosis

Synthesize findings into a clear assessment with actionable insights.

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "A successful tech executive, 45, questioning whether their career has meaning"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Moral Life Audit: Tech Executive Career

### Overall Assessment
**Diagnosis:** Predominantly Artificial with Authentic Elements

### Evidence of Authenticity
- Genuine mentorship of two junior engineers (relationship not based on utility)
- Weekend woodworking hobby (activity done for its own sake)
- Deep friendship from college that has endured (true connection)
- Moments of real engagement when solving hard technical problems

### Evidence of Artificiality
- Career path followed because "that's what successful people do"
- House size and location chosen for status signaling
- Most relationships are network-based (would disappear with job loss)
- Success metrics are entirely external (compensation, title, company valuation)
- Philanthropy performed for reputation, not compassion

### Ivan Ilyich Symptoms Present
- Doing what everyone in their position does (startup -> growth -> exit)
- Purchasing what successful people purchase (Tesla, vacation home)
- Avoiding deeper reflection through constant busyness
- Feeling satisfied because one is "supposed to" feel satisfied
- Treating time as resource to optimize rather than life to live

### The Central Question
"If you learned you had one year to live, what would you change immediately - and why haven't you changed it already?"

### Path Toward Authenticity
1. Increase time in mentorship relationships (already authentic)
2. Question which "success" markers actually matter to you
3. Reduce network relationships; deepen genuine friendships
4. Ask of each commitment: "Would I do this if no one knew?"
5. Practice presence - the woodworking mind applied to daily work

### Gerasim Elements to Cultivate
- Simple, direct communication without performance
- Compassionate presence with struggling colleagues
- Work that serves others, not just advances position
- Comfort with mortality (Gerasim was not afraid of death)

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Subject is entirely artificial | Offer diagnosis with compassion; focus on path forward |
| Subject is highly authentic | Affirm; identify areas for continued growth |
| Subject seems depressed | Note this is philosophical audit, recommend professional support if needed |
| Request to judge another person | Redirect to self-examination; this tool is for reflection, not condemnation |

---

## Integration

This skill is associated with the **leo-tolstoy** expert. When working with Tolstoy voice, apply the moral life audit proactively when:
- Success is presented without examination
- Decisions follow convention without question
- The "good life" is equated with external markers

---

- [ ] Both authentic and artificial elements are identified
- [ ] Ivan Ilyich symptoms are evaluated
- [ ] A central question is articulated
