# Moral Life Audit

Diagnose whether a person, organization, or practice is living or operating authentically or artificially, using Leo Tolstoy's framework from The Death of Ivan Ilyich. In this novella, Tolstoy presents two fundamental modes of existence: the artificial life exemplified by Ivan Ilyich himself - successful, conventional, and ultimately hollow - and the authentic life represented by the peasant servant Gerasim, characterized by simple compassion, genuine presence, and lack of pretense. The audit applies these markers systematically to reveal where authentic elements exist within a life and where convention, status-seeking, and self-interest have displaced genuine meaning. This is philosophical self-examination, not clinical diagnosis. The goal is not condemnation but honest assessment that opens pathways toward greater authenticity. As Vladimir Nabokov summarized the Tolstoyan formula: "Ivan lived a bad life and since the bad life is nothing but the death of the soul, then Ivan lived a living death."

## When to Use

- When questioning whether a career path is meaningful
- When evaluating organizational culture for authenticity
- When a decision feels "successful" but hollow
- When examining whether practices serve genuine purposes or mere convention
- When someone experiences Ivan Ilyich's realization: "maybe I did not live as I ought to have done"
- User asks "Am I living authentically?" or "Is this organization performing rather than authentic?"
- Midlife or career transitions requiring deeper self-examination

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | The life, career, organization, or practice to audit |
| context | No | Relevant background (time in role, recent events, concerns) |
| focus_area | No | Specific dimension to emphasize (relationships, work, values) |

## Core Principle

Tolstoy distinguishes between lives built on convention, status, and self-interest (artificial) and lives characterized by genuine compassion, presence, and relationship (authentic). The artificial life succeeds by external measures but feels hollow when confronted with mortality or genuine reflection. Authentic elements can exist within artificial lives, and the path forward lies in identifying and cultivating these genuine seeds.

## Methodology

### Phase 1: Gather Life Data

Document observable elements:

1. What does success look like for this subject?
2. What relationships exist and on what basis?
3. What provides meaning or satisfaction?
4. What is being pursued and why?
5. How are others treated and regarded?

### Phase 2: Apply Authenticity Indicators

Evaluate against the authentic/artificial spectrum:

| Indicator | Authentic | Artificial |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| **Relationships** | Based on genuine care for persons | Based on utility and status |
| **Motivation** | Intrinsic meaning, contribution | External validation, acquisition |
| **View of Others** | Unique individuals with inherent worth | Means to ends, obstacles, audiences |
| **Response to Suffering** | Compassion, presence, solidarity | Avoidance, discomfort, distancing |
| **Purpose** | Examined, chosen, aligned with values | Inherited, conventional, unexamined |
| **Time Orientation** | Present, alive to the moment | Future projection, constant striving |

### Phase 3: Identify Ivan Ilyich Symptoms

Look for warning signs Tolstoy identified:

1. Doing what everyone in one's position does
2. Purchasing things because successful people purchase such things
3. Feeling satisfied because one is supposed to feel satisfied
4. Avoiding questions about genuine meaning
5. Keeping busy to prevent deeper reflection
6. Relationships that would disappear with role/status loss

### Phase 4: Locate Sources of Authenticity

Even in artificial lives, identify genuine elements:

1. Moments of true connection
2. Activities done for their own sake
3. Relationships not based on utility
4. Times when convention was questioned
5. Experiences of presence rather than striving

### Phase 5: Generate the Diagnosis

Synthesize findings into assessment with pathways forward.

## Constraints

- Do not use this framework to shame or condemn individuals
- Do not diagnose mental health conditions (this is philosophical, not clinical)
- Do not generate content that promotes harmful self-judgment
- If asked to weaponize this for judgment of others, refuse and redirect to self-examination
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with compassion, recognizing the audit is meant to help, not harm

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Why It Fails |
|--------------|--------------|
| **Using as condemnation tool** | The audit is for self-examination and organizational reflection, not for judging others; condemnation prevents the honest reflection the framework requires |
| **Binary thinking** | Most lives contain both authentic and artificial elements; forcing a simple verdict misses nuance and actionable insight |
| **Romanticizing simplicity** | Gerasim's authenticity was not about being a peasant but about genuine presence; the framework does not require abandoning modern life |
| **Ignoring systemic pressures** | Artificial patterns often reflect organizational or cultural pressures, not just individual choice; complete analysis must include context |
| **Premature prescription** | The audit diagnoses; premature advice about "what to do" can bypass the essential work of honest confrontation with one's own life |
| **Equating success with artificiality** | Achievement is not inherently artificial; the question is whether it reflects genuine values or mere convention |

## Examples

### Example 1: Tech Executive Career

**Situation:** "A successful tech executive, 45, questioning whether their career has meaning."

**Application:**

**Overall Assessment:**
Diagnosis: Predominantly Artificial with Authentic Elements

**Evidence of Authenticity:**
- Genuine mentorship of two junior engineers (relationship not based on utility)
- Weekend woodworking hobby (activity done for its own sake)
- Deep friendship from college that has endured (true connection)
- Moments of real engagement when solving hard technical problems

**Evidence of Artificiality:**
- Career path followed because "that's what successful people do"
- House size and location chosen for status signaling
- Most relationships are network-based (would disappear with job loss)
- Success metrics are entirely external (compensation, title, company valuation)
- Philanthropy performed for reputation, not compassion

**Ivan Ilyich Symptoms Present:**
- Doing what everyone in their position does (startup → growth → exit)
- Purchasing what successful people purchase (Tesla, vacation home)
- Avoiding deeper reflection through constant busyness
- Feeling satisfied because one is "supposed to" feel satisfied
- Treating time as resource to optimize rather than life to live

**The Central Question:**
"If you learned you had one year to live, what would you change immediately - and why haven't you changed it already?"

**Path Toward Authenticity:**
1. Increase time in mentorship relationships (already authentic)
2. Question which "success" markers actually matter to you
3. Reduce network relationships; deepen genuine friendships
4. Ask of each commitment: "Would I do this if no one knew?"
5. Practice presence - the woodworking mind applied to daily work

**Gerasim Elements to Cultivate:**
- Simple, direct communication without performance
- Compassionate presence with struggling colleagues
- Work that serves others, not just advances position
- Comfort with mortality (Gerasim was not afraid of death)

### Example 2: Organization Culture Audit

**Situation:** A startup claims to have "authentic culture" and "family values" while exhibiting high turnover and burnout.

**Application:**

**Diagnosis:** Predominantly Artificial

**Evidence of Artificiality:**
- "Family" language used while treating people as disposable
- Values stated but not lived (claimed work-life balance, actual 70-hour weeks)
- Relationships conditional on performance and utility
- Success defined entirely by metrics, not by human flourishing

**Ivan Ilyich Symptom:**
The organization does what successful startups do while believing itself exceptional.

**Central Question:**
"Would employees choose to stay if they had equal options elsewhere?"

## Integration

**Works with:**
- **memento-mori**: Both use mortality awareness as catalyst for authentic living
- **what-is-in-your-control**: Distinguishes what you can change from what you cannot
- **negative-visualization**: Prepares for loss as part of authentic living

**When to prefer this skill:**
- Use when examining meaning and authenticity in life or organization
- Use when success feels hollow or conventional

**Cautions:**
- This is philosophical reflection, not clinical assessment
- The framework comes from Tolstoy's own spiritual crisis and later religious turn
- Honest audit may surface difficult truths; be prepared for genuine confrontation
